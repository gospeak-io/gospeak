<h2>Business model</h2>
<p>No business model yet, it's a personal project from HumanTalks Paris organizers to answers their needs.</p>
<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/gospeak-io/gospeak">open source</a>, and will always be.</p>
<p>The hosted service is free but depending on hosting costs, we will need to generate some revenue, but no plan for that yet.</p>
