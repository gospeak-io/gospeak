<p>Hello @req.user.firstName,</p>
<p>Welcome to Gospeak, you can create talks and propose them to meetups or conferences in an easy to use interface.</p>
<p>If you are an organizer you can create your group, launch a CFP and organise proposals. You can even look for talks that speaker made public and suggest them to do a proposal to the CFP.</p>
<p>But for now, can you just click on the <a href="@AuthCtrl.doValidateAccount(emailValidation.id).absoluteURL()">account validation link</a>, to validate your email?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, we hope you will enjoy Gospeak and make amazing talks or events \o/</p>
<p>The Gospeak team</p>
